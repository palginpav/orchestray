Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [2.0.6] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Inventor agent** — 10th core agent. First-principles creation specialist that designs and prototypes novel tools, DSLs, and custom solutions. Includes Phase 5 self-assessment gate (RECOMMEND / DO NOT RECOMMEND) to prevent unnecessary reinvention.
- **Effort/reasoning level routing** — PM assigns `low`/`medium`/`high`/`max` effort alongside model selection. Default mapping: haiku→low, sonnet→medium, opus→high. Configurable via `default_effort`, `force_effort`, `effort_routing`.
- Effort shown in agent descriptions when overridden (e.g., `"Design auth (opus/max)"`)
- Inventor delegation example in delegation-templates.md
- Inventor routing default in scoring-rubrics.md (Opus default, never Haiku)
- Effort assignment section in scoring-rubrics.md with anti-patterns and escalation rules
- `effort_assigned`, `effort_override`, `effort_override_reason` fields in routing_outcome event schema
- 3 new config settings: `default_effort`, `force_effort`, `effort_routing`

### Fixed
- `complexity-precheck.js`: added `process.exit(0)` on early-return paths (hook hung until timeout)
- `install.js`: fixed mergeHooks broken duplicate-detection predicate (both conditions now on same entry)
- `reassign-idle-teammate.js`: added stdout JSON response before exit-code-2 (was missing)
- `collect-agent-metrics.js`: NaN-safe token accumulation with `Number()` coercion
- `collect-agent-metrics.js`: wired to `TaskCompleted` hook for Agent Teams cost tracking (was dead code)
- Report skill now reads both `agent_stop` and `task_completed_metrics` events for cost aggregation
- PM Section 3/13/17/20 incomplete agent enumeration lists (missing refactorer, security-engineer, inventor)
- `pattern-extraction.md`: fixed stale "step 10" reference (actual: step 5)
- `scoring-rubrics.md`: added missing security-engineer routing default (never Haiku)

### Changed
- PM prompt expanded from 34 to 34 sections (2,500 → 2,574 lines); no new section numbers, content added to existing sections
- Config defaults now include 33 keys (was 30, added 3 effort settings)
- 10 core agents (was 9, added Inventor)
- Agent descriptions show effort level when overridden from model default

## [2.0.5] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Refactorer agent** — 9th core agent for systematic code transformation without behavior change. Bridges the architect/developer gap with behavioral equivalence verification.
- **Repository map** — compact codebase representation injected into agent prompts, reducing exploration overhead by 60-75%. Per-agent filtering, staleness detection, incremental regeneration.
- **User correction ingestion** — captures direct user corrections as high-confidence patterns. Auto-detection during orchestration, post-orchestration, and manual via `/orchestray:learn correct`.
- **Pattern effectiveness dashboard** — `/orchestray:patterns` shows pattern inventory, application history, confidence trajectories, estimated savings, and actionable recommendations.
- **PR review mode** — `/orchestray:review-pr` reviews GitHub PRs using the reviewer agent. Fetches diff via `gh`, optionally posts findings as review comments.
- **Trajectory analysis** — execution timeline in `/orchestray:report` showing agent sequencing, parallelism, per-agent metrics, and SWE-agent-style insights.
- **Agent description format** — model name shown in background agent UI instead of redundant agent type.
- **Model routing enforcement** — PM must pass explicit `model` parameter on Agent() calls; agents no longer silently inherit parent model.
- 3 new skills: `/orchestray:patterns`, `/orchestray:review-pr`, `/orchestray:learn correct`
- 2 new config settings: `enable_repo_map`, `post_pr_comments`
- PM Section 34 (User Correction Protocol), repo map protocol reference, event schemas for `agent_stop` and `pattern_pruned`

### Fixed
- Agent description bug: background agent UI showed agent type instead of routed model name
- Model routing: agents inherited parent Opus instead of using routed model (now enforced via explicit `model` parameter)
- Double backtick in architect.md line 149 breaking prompt rendering
- `.claude-plugin/` directory missing from package.json `files` array (plugin undiscoverable on npm)
- stdin error handlers added to all 6 hook scripts (was missing on 4)
- install.js banner printed before uninstall check
- install.js missing `'use strict'` directive
- Pricing comment year updated from 2025 to 2026
- Analytics skill step 8 referenced wrong frontmatter field names
- CLAUDE.md missing security-engineer agent and 5 skill commands
- PM Section 17 and Section 13 missing refactorer/security-engineer from agent lists
- Delegation templates missing user-correction and repo map steps
- Learn skill template missing user-correction category
- Report skill missing cross-references to analytics/patterns

### Changed
- PM prompt expanded from 34 to 35 sections (2,330 → ~2,500 lines)
- Config defaults now include 32 keys (was 30)
- Refactorer added to all PM agent lists, routing defaults, and delegation patterns
- Pre-scan (step 2.7) replaced by richer repository map generation

## [2.0.4] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- **GitHub Issue integration** — `/orchestray:issue` skill orchestrates directly from GitHub issues via `gh` CLI. PM auto-detects issue URLs in prompts, creates branches, maps labels to templates, optionally comments results back.
- **CI/CD feedback loop** — PM runs `ci_command` after orchestration, auto-fixes failures up to `ci_max_retries` attempts. Delivers verified, merge-ready code.
- **Mid-orchestration checkpoints** — pause between groups to review, modify, or abort. User sees results and controls flow with continue/modify/review/abort commands.
- **Structured plan editing** — modify tasks during preview: `remove`, `model`, `add`, `swap` commands before execution starts.
- **User-authored playbooks** — `.orchestray/playbooks/*.md` files inject project-specific instructions into agent delegation prompts. CRUD via `/orchestray:playbooks`.
- **Correction memory** — PM learns from verify-fix loops. Correction patterns extracted, stored, and applied to prevent repeated mistakes.
- **Cost prediction** — pre-execution cost estimates from historical data, with post-orchestration accuracy tracking.
- **Agent checkpointing** — per-agent state persistence for reliable resume after interruptions.
- **Pattern effectiveness dashboard** — `/orchestray:analytics` now shows pattern applications, correction effectiveness, and learning trends.
- **Team configuration** — `.orchestray/team-config.json` (version-controlled) sets team-wide policies, overrideable by individual config.
- **Team patterns** — `.orchestray/team-patterns/` for shared patterns across team members. `/orchestray:learn promote` copies local patterns to team.
- **Daily/weekly cost budgets** — `daily_cost_limit_usd` and `weekly_cost_limit_usd` with 80% warning and 100% hard stop.
- Model displayed in all agent status messages (before-group, after-agent, checkpoint results)
- 7 new config settings: `ci_command`, `ci_max_retries`, `post_to_issue`, `enable_checkpoints`, `daily_cost_limit_usd`, `weekly_cost_limit_usd`
- 2 new skills: `/orchestray:issue`, `/orchestray:playbooks`
- PM Sections 25-33 (9 new sections)

### Fixed
- Installer now copies `agents/pm-reference/` directory (previously missing for all installed users)
- Complexity hook no longer scores internal Claude Code messages (task-notification, command-name XML)
- KB index auto-reconciles when empty but files exist in subdirectories
- Token usage fallback chain: transcript → event payload → turn-based estimation (fixes $0.0000 analytics)
- History archive structure standardized (mandatory flat layout with events.jsonl)
- config.json created with all 27 defaults during first-run onboarding
- plugin.json version and URLs synced with package.json
- `security-engineer` added to reserved names (was already present)
- PM section reference updated from "Sections 1-15" to "Sections 1-33"

### Changed
- PM prompt expanded from 24 to 34 sections (1,836 → 2,330 lines)
- Config defaults now include all 27 keys (was 17, missing 10 routing/model keys)
- `usage_source` field added to audit events (transcript/event_payload/estimated)
- Session ID tracked in auto-trigger markers for staleness validation
- Pattern loading now searches both local and team-patterns directories
- Cost budget check runs before task decomposition

## [2.0.3] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- **Security Engineer** — 8th core agent with shift-left security analysis (design review + implementation audit)
- Pipeline templates — 7 workflow archetypes (bug fix, new feature, refactor, test, docs, migration, security audit) for consistent task decomposition
- TDD orchestration mode — test-first workflow: architect → tester → developer → reviewer (`tdd_mode` config)
- Adaptive complexity thresholds — self-calibrating orchestration trigger based on historical signals
- Codebase pre-scan — one-time lightweight project overview on first orchestration (`enable_prescan` config)
- Orchestration preview — task graph with cost estimates before execution (`confirm_before_execute` config)
- Regression detection — test baseline before/after orchestration (`enable_regression_check` config)
- Static analysis integration — run linters before reviewer step (`enable_static_analysis` config)
- 5 new specialist templates: performance-engineer, release-engineer, migration-specialist, accessibility-specialist, api-designer

- Installer reads version from package.json instead of hardcoded string

## [2.0.2] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- Fix zero-token transcript parsing — cost tracking now reads `entry.message.usage` (Claude Code's actual format)
- Add cache creation token pricing (25% surcharge) to cost estimates
- Fix KB index sync — added `/orchestray:kb reconcile` command to rebuild index from files
- Standardize event field parsing (`event` vs `type`) for backward compatibility in analytics/report skills
- Remove unconditional debug logging from complexity-precheck.js (now gated behind `verbose` config)
- Fix stale auto-trigger.json cleanup (markers older than 5 minutes auto-deleted)
- Fix empty task archives — state directory now properly copied to history on completion

### Added
- `effort` frontmatter field on all 7 agents (pm: high, architect: high, developer: medium, reviewer: medium, debugger: high, tester: medium, documenter: low)
- `max_cost_usd` config setting for per-orchestration budget enforcement
- `turns_used` metric displayed in `/orchestray:analytics` (turns by agent type table)
- PM prompt size reduction — reference material extracted to `agents/pm-reference/` (loaded on-demand)
